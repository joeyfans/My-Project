        <div>My name is Jonathan Faks and im 15 years old, I have a tough challenge I have been facing for years. When I was 6 years old my parents noticed me doing wierd movements. They took me to the doctor and he said its an involantar movement and it should go away by the time im 14. Ever since 14 it got stronger and so I went to a Neurologist and he diagnosed me with Tourettes Syndrome. He gave me medications and that helps alot but still today im still fighting. Now the reason im saying this story is because I got bullied too much and I always wanted to end it but deep down i knew it wasn't possible. Then I started seeing these organizations and im trying to be pat of them. So thats alittle about my self.
